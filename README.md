Quickly and easily add text infront of or behind of lines in a file.
This build comes with a registration module which can be used if needed.

The system can make backups of the file to ensure that any errors during the processing of the file does not affect the original file.

The system uses a worker thread to process the actual file so the UI will not lock up when processing big files.

Some screenshots of the system:
